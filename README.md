EmotionDetectionInText 

Emotion detection from textual data is a critical task in natural language processing, with applications in sentiment analysis, human–computer interaction, and mental health monitoring. This project presents a machine learning–based emotion classification system that integrates statistical text modeling with rule-based linguistic refinement to improve prediction reliability. The system processes raw textual inputs through a structured preprocessing pipeline that includes noise removal, handling data imbalance, and negation handling. Feature extraction is performed using both CountVectorizer and TF-IDF representations with n-gram support.
Multiple supervised learning models—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Decision Tree—are trained and evaluated using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. Among the evaluated models, the Support Vector Machine classifier combined with CountVectorizer achieved the highest classification accuracy, outperforming other model–vectorizer combinations in terms of predictive performance.
To address semantic limitations inherent in data-driven models, a rule-based post-processing layer is incorporated to handle negation-driven emotional shifts, such as negated positive and negated negative expressions. This hybrid approach enhances interpretability and corrects logically inconsistent predictions without altering underlying probability distributions.
The finalized model is deployed through a Streamlit-based web application that enables real-time emotion prediction, confidence visualization, and transparency regarding rule application. Experimental results confirm that combining machine learning with linguistic rules improves robustness and user trust. The proposed system demonstrates an effective, interpretable, and deployable solution for emotion detection from text.

Proposed System:
The proposed system introduces a machine learning–based emotion classification framework designed to overcome limitations of traditional text-based emotion detection methods, particularly in handling negation and class imbalance. The system emphasizes interpretability and efficiency by utilizing classical machine learning models and statistical text representation techniques.
•	The framework begins with a structured preprocessing pipeline that performs text normalization, noise removal, and tokenization while explicitly preserving negation words such as not, no, and never. A negation-aware transformation is applied to capture negated emotional expressions by modifying affected tokens, enabling vectorization techniques to retain semantic context. Class imbalance is handled using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique  (SMOTE).
•	Feature extraction is carried out using Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF representations with n-gram support to capture local contextual patterns. These features are used to train multiple supervised classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. To address class imbalance, stratified data splitting and class-weighted learning are incorporated, ensuring fair representation of minority emotion classes during training.
•	Following model prediction, a rule-based post-processing layer is employed to correct logically inconsistent outputs caused by negation-driven emotional shifts. This hybrid approach enhances prediction reliability without altering the learned model parameters.
•	The optimized classifier is deployed through a Streamlit-based web application that enables real-time emotion prediction from user input. The interface displays predicted emotions along with confidence scores and transparency regarding rule-based adjustments. Overall, the proposed system delivers an accurate, interpretable, and deployable solution for emotion classification from text using classical machine learning techniques.
•	This system is highly relevant to real-world applications such as social media analysis, customer feedback evaluation, mental health monitoring, and human–computer interaction systems.
